# Project Management System

## How to Run the Application

### Backend (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the Spring Boot application using Gradle:

   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

The backend server will start on port 8080 (default Spring Boot port).

### Frontend (React/Vite)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   Or using pnpm (recommended):

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with pnpm:

   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

The frontend development server will start on port 5173 (Vite's default).

## Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at:
http://localhost:5173
